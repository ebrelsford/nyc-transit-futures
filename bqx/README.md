Geodata for the proposed Brooklyn-Queens waterfront streetcar.

This data was created by tracing OpenStreetMap data and referencing [this map](http://weheartastoria.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Brooklyn-Queens-Streetcar-Proposal-Map-NYC.jpg) accessed via [this article](http://www.6sqft.com/1-7b-light-rail-connecting-the-brooklyn-queens-waterfront-proposed/). While tracing, we attempted to make the streetcar go the correct direction on oneway streets. The map has some landmarks and some streets labeled, but we had to approximate the route sometimes.

The map presented in the [Daily News](www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn-queens-waterfront-streetcar-proposed-article-1.2519542) is much less specific and does not include the connection to Atlantic Terminal.
